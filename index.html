            <h3> Your Average Teenager </h3>
            <p> Yeah. I know I'm still a teenager dreaming. But I know that if I work hard, I will accomplish my goals in life and be a successful man someday. I will do my best to pursue the life I wanted. </p>

             <p> I already learned basic HTML and CSS thanks to the application called <span style=color:magenta;><em>Programming Hero </em></span>. I hope I further improve my skills so that I can safely say that I'm a Web Developer. My goal this month at least, is to develop 3 or more websites with different designs. I will use what I learned and hope for the best. </p>

            <p class="purple-color"> May 24, 2020 | Learning Web Developing </p>
            <p> Due to COVID-19, I am stucked here at home. Since I don't know that to do, I thought what I might expect to learn on Senior Highschool and Web Developing is part of it. So, I decided I need to learn how to do that. </p>

            <p class="purple-color"> May 25 - Present | Baby Web Developer </p>
            <p> I'm starting to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Right now I'm making my own website with <em> Programming Hero </em> guiding me. </p>
